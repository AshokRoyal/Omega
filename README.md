Readme for Omega Base Theme global.css

This is intended to make subtheming using the Omega Theme system quicker by creating a 
global.css file located within the example/css directory with commonly used and overridden values. 

The colors are meant to be replaced but serve as a visual reference to orient you to the locations
of the various zones and wrappers. 

It adds wrappers around the content for better coloring.

It requires the Omega them folder because it is an Omega base theme.

Be sure to set the menu zone in the theme settings to dynamic, otherwise it won't display.

This 3.x Branch updates the Omega base theme to reflect the latest updates from http://drupal.org/project/omega
